It also highlights the close link between supervision and education in the skills of teaching and learning. The course clarifies how a supervisor may meet a PhD student as an individual by taking an inclusive approach and, with that student, build a relationship based on mutual understanding of postgraduate education in general and the student’s research project in particular. The course provides plenty of opportunity for discussion and reflection on how to start up and follow the doctoral supervision process in different phases.</p>

This means that, before a session, participants will be expected to read relevant literature and complete tasks to facilitate discussion. Participants’ own experience in these discussions is seen as crucial in building up an understanding of this area.
The focus will be on diversity in terms of culture, gender and special needs. Discussions will focus on key issues in these areas and models for interpreting them, so as to produce as inclusive an education as possible.</p>

<p> The course focuses on the recent worldwide paradigm shift in higher education from teaching to learning. Today’s university lecturers are expected to be more of a “guide on the side” than a “sage on the stage”, more of a facilitator of learning than a presenter of information. Three fundamental questions therefore form the backbone of the course:<br>
- What do we want our students to learn, and how can we make the goals clear to our them?<br>
- How do we arrange teaching so that our students have the greatest chance of learning?<br>
- How can we find out whether they have learnt what we wanted them to learn?<br>
An important idea tied to these questions is constructive alignment, which means that different aspects of a teaching and learning situation should be brought together in a mutually reinforcing way that supports student learning.</p>

						<p>This module is aimed at graduate students who are doing or intend to do advanced research in algorithms design and analysis in all areas of computer science. The module covers advanced material on combinatorial algorithms, with emphasis on efficient algorithms, and explores their use in a variety of application areas. Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, linear programming, graph matching and network congestion, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, online algorithms, and learning algorithms. It is a seminar-based module that will expose students to the state-of-the-art and also the current research in these areas.</p>

Students will learn about the framework for algorithm analysis, for example, lower bound arguments, average case analysis, and the theory of NP-completeness. In addition, students are exposed to various algorithm design paradigms. The module serves two purposes: to improve the students' ability to design algorithms in different areas, and to prepare students for the study of more advanced algorithms. The module covers lower and upper bounds, recurrences, basic algorithm paradigms (such as prune-and-search, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound, graph traversal, and randomised approaches), amortized analysis, NP-completeness, and some selected advanced topics.</p>
