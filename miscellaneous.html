     							<p>Translated by Debabrota Basu</p>
<p> Edited by Zakir Hossain Khokan & Monir Ahmod</p>

<p>Migrant Tales is a bilingual anthology of poems by migrant Bengali poets in Singapore. It is published in Singapore and Bangladesh. Following its launch at <a href="https://www.singaporeworkerpoetry.com/">Singapore migrant worker poetry competition</a> in December, 2016, it is featured at the poetry reading events in Singapore and also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekushey_Book_Fair">Ekushey (21st) book fair</a> in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p>

<p> Representation of each poem alternatively in Bengali and English depicts the two-fold existence of migrants. Bengali version reflects the old selves of them that they left at their homes. On the other hand, the English version unveils their endeavour to reinvent themselves in this new space-time. In this new world, they hardly find the caress of their mother tongue but often come across glimpses of old selves and an unquenchable longing to return.</p>
<p> This book is meant to create a poetic bonding between the local residents and the migrant poets. It is also meant to reassure  the compatriots that all who left home are not gone.</p>

<p>Zebra Crossing is a poetic play that consists of six poems written by three poets from three countries and different streams of life.</p>

<p>Zebra crossing is a portal that city dwellers use every day to reach destinations and return home. It is a perfect metaphor to portray the layers and colours of life, migration and, above all, to celebrate the shared experience of being human. Zebra Crossing depicts the stories of a mother-daughter pair working as housekeepers, a shoresman, and two city-dwellers reflecting on life. Through these diverse stories, the presentation explores life as a crossroad of unheard human stories, and poetry as the rhythm that unifies them.</p>

<p>In 2018-2019, Zebra Crossing has been featured in Singapore for multiple shows at the Esplande Theatre Concourse, Shantanjali Festival of Arts, Migrant Literature Festival, SingLit Station etc.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure that the play is reopened again in 2020 after my departure from Singapore.</p>
